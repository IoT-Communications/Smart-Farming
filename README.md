# Smart Farming
This is a Smart Farming solution that involves the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help farmers mitigate the effects of climate change. Traditional agricultural practices have increasingly become ineffective due to unpredicatable climate change, thus leading to a decrease in food production. This solution uses wireless sensors to remotely monitor farm components such as soil quality, water supply and weather data. Artificial intelligence is then used to analyse the data and provide farmers with actionable intelligence on how best to improve their farming practices in an effort to raise the quality of the yield and increase food production under the given circumstances.
